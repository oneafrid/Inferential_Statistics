# Inferential_Statistics

the _z_-statistic
the _t_-statistic
the difference and relationship between the two
the Central Limit Theorem, its assumptions and consequences
how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
how to combine these concepts to calculate confidence intervals and p-values
how those confidence intervals and p-values allow you to perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests

# Understanding above fundamental concepts associated with frequentist inference, Variance and Bootstrap Sample
Modelling the distribution of individual charges and we also really want to be able to capture our uncertainty about that distribution so we can better capture the range of values we might see. This naturally leads us to a powerful, probabilistic approach â€” we'll use the pymc3 library to perform Bayesian inference.
